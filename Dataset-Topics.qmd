Things you plan to investigate using this dataset:

- The frequency of police stops by age (possibly analyzing alongside race if possible?)
- Most common amount of officer present at police stop
- How many of those stopped at the time of the survey taken had encountered police within the last 12 months

Stat 351 topics you plan to cover during the analysis:

1. Web scraping
2. "Big" Data
3. Animated/Interactive graphics
4. APIs (if not necessarily appropriate, most likely PDF tools)
